This project repository demonstates the workflow of building recurrent neural network model to predict name entity lables using tensor flow. With a simple structure of one embedding layer, one biderectional LSTM layer and one dense layer, prediction accuracy on held-out test data set can achieve above .95 on CONLL-2003 data set. Please check the Jupiter Noterbook in the Repo directly of have a look a the project __<ins>blog post</ins>__ (https://halfmoonliu.github.io/posts/use-bilstm-for-name-entity-recognition/) for a brief introduction to the workflow (tokenization, padding, model buildup, hyper parameter tuning and test).
